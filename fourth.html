        <h2 style="color: #D5F2E2;">StarryNight has gone down as a classic example of net art, to take advantage of the internet and
            make something that can't be done anywhere else, in this case, make an exciting take on forum
            archives. Not only that, it did its job of archiving the vital exchanges between late 90s net artists,
            even if some of it's lost.
            Since its creation in 1999, this art piece has been exhibited throughout the world, from Austria to
            Spain. StarryNight's most recent showing was its restoration in May 2019 at the New Museum in
            New York as part of "The Art Happens Here: Net Art's Archival Poetics.â€™
