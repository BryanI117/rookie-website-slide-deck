      <h1 style="color: #D5F2E2;">Let's start</h1>
      <h2 style="color: #D5F2E2;">Rhizome has focused on discussing, creating, and preserving digital and new media art and culture since 1996 when it started as an email discussion list about the same topic. Around Rhizome's launch, Alex Galloway, Mark Tribe, and Martin Wattenberg conceived a web-accessible database archiving the organization's email messages, an important and novel idea. Remember, this forum held some critical discussions for new-form artists during the late 90's; losing the exchanges of resources and information of this time would be a big deal. Galloway, Tribe, and Wattenberg must've realized that, so instead of making a generic archive list, they decided that it had to look special, so they decided to make the archive look like the night sky; what else would you expect from a group of new-form artists? In 1999, Starry Night was born; about five messages every week would be saved to an archive called Textbase. You get to read messages made by digital artists from the 90s; you might even find some messages written in other languages like German.</h2>
